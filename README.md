# Alzheimers-Prediction
This project involved using ICD-9 diagnosis codes from Medicare Insurance claims data to predict whether an individual would later develop Alzheimer's. The project involved converting the data from a wide form to long-form within SAS and then exporting the file into R. There, I trained a number of supervised machine learning methods on the data to create my predictions.
